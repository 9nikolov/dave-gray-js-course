Modern browsers have varying levels of support for ES6 modules. 
To ensure compatibility across different browsers, developers 
often use tools like Babel, which transpile newer versions of 
JavaScript into older ones that are supported by a wider range of browsers.

This allows developers to take advantage of the latest JavaScript features while
still ensuring that their code works correctly across different environments.
