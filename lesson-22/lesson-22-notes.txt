HTML "defer" attribute in <script> tag

HTML CODE: <script defer src="main.js"></script>
The defer attribute in a <script> tag tells the browser to wait until the HTML document
is fully parsed before executing the JavaScript code in the specified file. 
This means that the script will be loaded asynchronously, but it won't execute until 
the HTML parsing is complete.
