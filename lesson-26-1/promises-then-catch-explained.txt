QUESTION: 

please explain how this code works

how does .then(), know that the value parameter is the result of the promise,
and how does .catch() know that the parameter is the error

QUESTION CODE:
======================================================================
======================================================================
======================================================================
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const error = false;
  if (error === false) {
    resolve("Yes! Resolved Promise!");
  } else {
    reject("No! Rejected Promise!");
  }
});

console.log(myPromise);

myPromise
  .then((value) => {
    return value + 1;
  })
  .then((value2) => {
    console.log(value2);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(err);
  });


ANSWER:
======================================================================
======================================================================
======================================================================

In this code, a Promise is created using the new Promise() constructor. 
Inside this constructor, there's a function with resolve and reject parameters. 
When the Promise is created and executed, it either resolves (succeeds) or rejects (fails) based on certain conditions.

Let's break down how the code works step by step:

A Promise myPromise is created with a callback function that takes two parameters, resolve and reject.

Inside the callback function, there's a condition (if statement) that checks if error is false. 
In this example, error is always false, so the Promise always resolves.

If the condition is true (error === false), resolve is called with the string "Yes! Resolved Promise!",
indicating that the Promise has succeeded.

If the condition is false, reject is called with the string "No! Rejected Promise!",
indicating that the Promise has failed.

The Promise myPromise is logged to the console.

.then() is used to handle the resolved Promise. When the Promise is resolved, .then() takes a callback function as its argument.
This callback function will be called with the resolved value, which in this case is "Yes! Resolved Promise!".

Inside the first .then() callback function, the resolved value ("Yes! Resolved Promise!") is received as the parameter value. 
Then, "Yes! Resolved Promise!" is concatenated with 1, which implicitly converts the number to a string,
resulting in "Yes! Resolved Promise!1".

The result of the first .then() callback ("Yes! Resolved Promise!1") is automatically passed to
the next .then() callback as its parameter (value2).

Inside the second .then() callback function, value2 (which is "Yes! Resolved Promise!1") is logged to the console.

If there was an error during the execution of the Promise (which doesn't happen in this example),
.catch() would be called instead of .then(). .catch() takes a callback function that receives
the error as its parameter. In this case, since there's no error, the .catch() block is not executed.

So, to answer your question, .then() knows that its parameter represents the 
resolved value of the Promise because it automatically receives the resolved value as 
an argument when the Promise resolves. Similarly, .catch() knows that its parameter represents the error
because it automatically receives the error as an argument when the Promise rejects.
This behavior is built into the Promise mechanism in JavaScript.
