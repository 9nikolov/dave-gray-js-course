// Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)
// The nullish coalescing (??) operator is a logical operator 
// that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined,
// and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.
// Examples:
const foo = null ?? 'default string';
console.log(foo);
// Expected output: "default string"

const baz = 0 ?? 42;
console.log(baz);
// Expected output: 0
